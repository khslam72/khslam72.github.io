Let me be honest with you: 'SHEESH' was *never* going to please everyone.

After months of teasers showing each member saying "sheesh" one by one (which felt like an eternity), BABYMONSTER finally dropped their official 7-member debut on April 1st, 2024. The MV hit **10 million views in hours**. The online forums exploded with **600+ comments overnight**. And the reactions? Wildly split down the middle.

Some people heard YG's next big thing. Others heard... well, more YG. The castle invasion concept looked expensive yet somehow cheap to some viewers. The choreography was praised and criticized in equal measure. Even that signature "sheesh!" sound—the hook the entire song was built around—had people either vibing or cringing.

But here's what I found interesting after watching this thing about 20 times and reading through hundreds of reactions: **the polarization is the point**. BABYMONSTER wasn't trying to make a universally loved song. They were making a statement about who they are, consequences be damned.

Let me break down what actually happened in this MV, why the reactions went the way they did, and what it means now that they've followed it up with 'DRIP.'

## First Reactions: The Comment Section War

Within hours of release, the battle lines were drawn. Let me show you what the actual netizen reactions looked like, because they tell the real story:

**The Praise Camp:**
- *"This is so much better than what I expected, and I keep listening to the song"*
- *"The song is catchy! I think I'm gonna keep listening to it"*
- *"The choreo is much better than I thought and the members are talented"*
- *"I love it when Chiquita is the center"*
- *"I don't know why people are hating on this, I like it"*

**The Skeptics:**
- *"It's like BLACKPINK...nothing more or nothing less"*
- *"Just the usual YG style..."*
- *"Am I the only one who prefers 'Batter Up'"*
- *"Am I the only one who is really bothered by that 'sheesh!' sound?"*
- *"I am so sorry, but I just can't listen to that 'sheesh' sound for very long..."*

**The Confused Middle:**
- *"It's clear that the members are talented but there's something missing here that I cannot pinpoint"*
- *"Why does the MV look cheap while simultaneously looking like they spent a lot of money on it??"*
- *"If this had come out 10 years ago I feel like it would have been an absolute hit"*

One comment perfectly captured the paradox: *"If this were to have been recorded by BLACKPINK, with a different MV, then the song would have garnered more love."* That sentence right there? That's the entire discourse in one line.

The performance wasn't weak—it was polarizing, which in the attention economy, still works.

<a name="visual-breakdown"></a>
## Visual Breakdown: The Castle Takeover

The MV concept is straightforward: seven members, one abandoned gothic castle, total domination. Let me walk through the key visual moments:

### Opening: The Arrival (0:00-0:25)

They don't sneak in. They don't ask permission. The camera opens on them already **inside** the castle, which immediately establishes the tone. This isn't an infiltration—it's a coronation. The castle isn't a challenge to overcome; it's a throne waiting for its rightful owners.

Watch **0:08** closely: Ruka's opening shot is backlit by massive windows, silhouetting her against the light. It's giving "final boss entering the arena" energy. The lighting choice here is deliberate—they're framed as larger-than-life figures before you even hear the music.

### The Throne Room Sequence (0:45-1:10)

At **0:52**, there's this incredible wide shot of all seven members spread across a grand hall with gothic architecture towering above them. The staging is hierarchical—some members elevated, others centered, all positioned like chess pieces on a board.

But here's where the "expensive yet cheap" comment from netizens makes sense: the set design is impressive, but the lighting sometimes feels flat. Compare this to, say, BLACKPINK's 'How You Like That' church scene, where dramatic shadows and spotlights created depth. Here, everything's a bit too evenly lit, which can make expensive sets feel like... sets.

### Choreography Sections (1:15-2:00)

The dance formations are where opinions split hardest. The choreography itself is **sharp**—at **1:35**, the synchronized arm movements during Chiquita's center moment are executed flawlessly. The formations change rapidly, keeping visual interest high.

But (and this is a big but) the MV cuts away so frequently that you never get to really *watch* the dance. It's more like a highlight reel than a showcase. One netizen nailed it: *"This MV looks more like a choreography version MV than an actual MV..."* There's a difference between showing choreography and telling a visual story through movement.

### Individual Member Moments

- **Ruka (0:08)**: Commands the opening with veteran presence
- **Pharita (0:32)**: Gets one of the clearest vocal moments, her tone cutting through cleanly
- **Asa (1:42)**: Her rap delivery is technically impressive but sometimes feels buried in the mix
- **Ahyeon (throughout)**: The return everyone waited for, though some commented *"I can't even spot Ahyeon in the MV..."*
- **Rami (2:15)**: Strong vocal control in the bridge section
- **Rora (2:18)**: Paired with Rami for the most praised section—more on that later
- **Chiquita (1:35)**: Multiple comments specifically praised her center moments

<a name="the-sheesh-debate"></a>
## The "SHEESH" Debate: Why It Split Everyone

Let's talk about the elephant in the room: that hook.

**"SHEESH"** is internet slang—the sound you make when something's impressive, shocking, or overwhelming. In theory, building a debut around this is brilliant. It's immediately recognizable, works across languages, and has built-in viral potential.

In practice? It divided the audience into two camps:

### Camp 1: "It's Genius"
The hook is **memorable** (you can't unhear it). It's **confident** (they're not asking if they're impressive—they're stating it). It's **meme-able** (which matters in 2024). The repetition isn't annoying; it's hypnotic.

### Camp 2: "I Can't Do This"
Some people physically couldn't get past it. *"Am I the only one who is really bothered by that 'sheesh!' sound?"* showed up repeatedly. The vocal delivery of "sheesh" is deliberately bratty and sharp, which works if you're vibing with the attitude but grates if you're not.

Here's my take after 20+ listens: **the "sheesh" works better in short-form content than full song format**. It's perfect for a 15-second TikTok or a 30-second teaser. Three minutes? That's where it starts testing patience for some listeners.

<a name="ahyeon-return"></a>
## The Ahyeon Factor: Completing the Seven

Context matters here: Ahyeon had been on hiatus, and 'SHEESH' marked the first official comeback with all seven members. For fans, this was huge—the group was finally **complete**.

But interestingly, some netizen reactions were: *"I can't even spot Ahyeon in the MV..."*

This speaks to a larger issue: with seven talented members and a 3-minute runtime, **screen time distribution** becomes a zero-sum game. Everyone can't have a spotlight moment without the pacing suffering. The MV tries to give everyone their time, but the result sometimes feels fragmented.

The return itself was symbolic more than visual. The narrative of "seven monsters united" carried weight for fans who'd followed the journey, but for casual viewers encountering them for the first time, that context was invisible.

<a name="what-worked"></a>
## What Worked (Even Critics Admitted It)

Let's be fair: even the skeptics had to admit certain things.

### 1. The Choreography Design

*"The choreo is much better than I thought"* came up repeatedly. The formations are complex, the synchronization is tight, and the energy is undeniable. At **1:35** and **2:25**, the group formations create satisfying geometric patterns that reward rewatching.

### 2. Individual Talent

*"I get that the members are talented, especially the rappers"* was almost universal. Even people who didn't like the song acknowledged the skill level. Asa's flow, Ruka's presence, the vocal line's control—nobody questioned their abilities.

### 3. The Bridge (Rora & Rami Section)

Multiple positive comments specifically highlighted **2:15-2:30**: *"The bridge where Rora & Rami are singing"* was praised for deviating from the aggressive energy and providing emotional contrast. This section strips away the production layers and lets vocal technique shine.

It's interesting that the most praised moment is the one that sounds *least* like "typical YG."

### 4. The Catchiness (For Better or Worse)

*"The song is catchy!"* — even people who were ambivalent admitted it stuck in their head. That's not nothing. A forgettable song is death. An annoying-but-memorable song? That can still work.

<a name="what-didnt"></a>
## What Didn't Land (And Why)

Now let's talk about the legitimate criticisms:

### 1. The BLACKPINK Shadow

*"It's like BLACKPINK...nothing more or nothing less"* and *"I can't wait for the AI version of BLACKPINK covering this"* were brutal but revealing. The comparison is unavoidable when you're under YG, but this song didn't do enough to differentiate.

The gothic castle setting, the girl crush concept, the rap-heavy verses into explosive chorus structure—it's the BLACKPINK formula without the evolution. One netizen nailed it: *"If this had come out 10 years ago I feel like it would have been an absolute hit."* Timing matters.

### 2. The MV's Identity Crisis

*"Why does the MV look cheap while simultaneously looking like they spent a lot of money on it??"*

This paradox plagued discussions. The sets are clearly expensive. The production budget was there. But something about the execution—the lighting, the editing pace, the lack of narrative cohesion—made it feel less impactful than it should have.

Compare this to newer groups like aespa or NMIXX whose MVs have distinct visual languages. 'SHEESH' feels like it's borrowing aesthetic elements without committing to a unified vision.

### 3. Vocal Distinctiveness

*"I can't tell their individual voices though...they escape my memory afterwards, which is a bad sign"*

This is a real problem for a debut. With seven members, you need vocal colors that are immediately recognizable. While technically strong, the members' voices blend more than they pop. After one listen, can you identify who sang what? That's the test they didn't fully pass.

### 4. The "Just YG" Problem

*"Oh dear....where have all of YG's good vibes gone..."*  
*"Just the usual YG style..."*

The formula fatigue is real. YG has a sound, an aesthetic, a swagger. It worked for BIGBANG, 2NE1, BLACKPINK because each felt like evolution. BABYMONSTER, at least in 'SHEESH,' felt like repetition.

<a name="drip-evolution"></a>
## From SHEESH to DRIP: The Evolution

Fast forward to October 2024: BABYMONSTER drops their first full album with title track **'DRIP.'**

And something interesting happened—the reception was notably **warmer**.

Why? Because 'DRIP' did what 'SHEESH' didn't: it showed **progression**. The sound was still confident, still YG-coded, but felt more refined. The MV had clearer direction. The members' individual colors started emerging.

'SHEESH' served its purpose as a **bold, polarizing declaration**. It said "we're here" loudly, even if not everyone wanted to listen. 'DRIP' said "we're staying, and here's why."

In retrospect, 'SHEESH' wasn't meant to be universally loved—it was meant to be **impossible to ignore**. Mission accomplished. The 200M views in a month, the endless forum debates, the passionate defenders and vocal critics—that's engagement. That's cultural penetration.

The question was never "will everyone like BABYMONSTER?" It was "will anyone be able to ignore them?" And after 'SHEESH,' the answer was definitively no.

<h3 style="color:#ff0066; margin-top:0;">👑 Rewatch Challenge: The Throne Count</h3>
<p>
Throughout the MV, there are actual thrones and throne-like furniture that appear in different scenes. Some are obvious, some are subtle background elements.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your mission:</strong> Count how many distinct throne or crown symbols you can spot throughout the entire MV (including set pieces, props, and visual motifs). I counted 8, but I might've missed some.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
Drop your count in the comments—and if you're team "loved it" or team "preferred Batter Up," I'm genuinely curious about your reasoning!

## Q&A: Your Questions Answered

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Why was the reaction to SHEESH so divided?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Multiple factors: 1) The "sheesh" hook is polarizing by design—you either vibe with the bratty confidence or find it grating. 2) The YG formula felt too familiar to some, revolutionary to others. 3) The BLACKPINK comparisons were inevitable and colored reception. 4) The MV's aesthetic didn't fully commit to a cohesive vision. 5) Timing—this sound might have hit differently 5 years ago. Basically, it's a love-it-or-hate-it song by nature, not accident.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">What does the castle symbolism represent?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>The abandoned gothic castle represents the K-pop throne room—old, established, waiting for new rulers. By setting the MV there and having them confidently occupy every room, they're making a statement: we're not asking for permission to be here. We're taking our place. The gothic aesthetic also creates a "monster" vibe that connects to their name—beautiful but dangerous, elegant but powerful.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">How important was Ahyeon's return for this comeback?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Symbolically huge for fans, but practically complex. Her return meant the group was finally "complete," which carried emotional weight for the fandom. However, it also meant distributing screen time across seven members in a 3-minute MV, which led to some members feeling underutilized. Some netizens couldn't even spot her clearly in certain scenes, which shows the challenge of balancing seven strong personalities in one frame.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Is SHEESH better or worse than BATTER UP?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Depends on what you value. BATTER UP was safer, catchier, more universally accessible—but also less distinctive. SHEESH is bolder, more aggressive, more divisive—but also more memorable. Netizen reactions showed many preferred BATTER UP's energy, but SHEESH made a bigger cultural splash precisely because it was polarizing. Neither is objectively "better"—they serve different strategic purposes.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Did the mixed reactions hurt or help BABYMONSTER?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Counterintuitively, probably helped. The song hit 200M views in just over a month and dominated YouTube charts despite (or because of) the discourse. In the attention economy, strong reactions—even negative ones—beat indifference. The passionate defenders became more vocal precisely because there were critics to argue with. By the time DRIP came out, everyone knew who BABYMONSTER was. That was the point.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">What did DRIP do differently that SHEESH didn't?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>DRIP showed evolution. The production felt more refined, the MV had clearer visual direction, and the members' individual vocal colors emerged more distinctly. Where SHEESH felt like a loud announcement, DRIP felt like a confident follow-through. It kept the attitude but added maturity. The warmer reception to DRIP validated that SHEESH's job was never to be loved—it was to get attention. DRIP's job was to keep it.</p>
