*How do you turn a term of endearment into a weapon? Ask IVE. Their B-side track **"XOXO"** takes the sweet "hugs and kisses" sign-off and flips it into a fiery, unapologetic kiss-off. Released alongside their monster debut "ELEVEN," this track's music video is a **'visual story'** not of heartbreak, but of pure, unbothered confidence. It’s the perfect anthem for anyone who's ever needed to say "no, thanks" with a smile. Let's get into it.*</p>

<h2 style="color: #00aaff;">Quick Summary: The Vibe Check (Bye, Sayonara!)</h2>
"XOXO" is a high-energy, pop-punk-infused track that showcases IVE's confident and rebellious side. The music video isn't a narrative drama but a vibrant display of attitude. Set in rebellious high-teen locations like rooftops and locker rooms, the MV is a visual feast of Y2K aesthetics and powerful choreography. It's a fan-favorite B-side that perfectly established IVE's core identity from their debut: chic, self-assured, and unafraid to set boundaries.

<h2 style="color: #00aaff;">The Story You See on Screen: An Attitude, Not a Plot</h2>
Unlike MVs with a deep storyline, "XOXO" tells its story through pure vibe and energy. It’s a visual declaration of freedom.

**1. The High-Teen Takeover:** The members are seen in classic school-themed settings—a locker room, a classroom, a gymnasium. But they're not studying. They're lounging on desks, dancing in the halls, and owning every space. It’s a classic teen movie trope flipped on its head: they aren't rebels *against* the system; they’re just too cool to care about it.

**2. Rooftop Liberation:** A huge chunk of the choreography takes place on a rooftop, a classic symbol of freedom and escape in youth culture. Dressed in edgy, coordinated outfits, their powerful dance moves against the city skyline scream confidence. This isn't about running away; it's about rising above.

**3. Playful Confidence:** Throughout the MV, the members share mischievous glances and playful interactions. There’s no crying over a breakup here. The mood is celebratory, fun, and just a little bit savage. The visual story is simple: being in control of your own feelings is the ultimate power.

<h2 style="color: #00aaff;">Lyrics & meaning: The Genius of a Sarcastic Kiss-Off</h2>
<h3 style="color: #304090;">The Intent Behind the Hook & Cultural Nuance (The Fun Analysis)</h3>

Okay, let's talk about the lyrics because they are just *brilliant*. They perfectly capture that moment you realize someone's affection is totally fake.

**1. "XOXO, that's a no-no":** This is the core of the song's genius. "XOXO" is universally known as "hugs and kisses," a sweet sign-off. By pairing it with "that's a no-no," IVE twists a symbol of affection into a sharp, dismissive rejection. It's the lyrical equivalent of smiling while saying, "I'd rather not." It's polite but absolutely brutal.

**2. A 4th Gen K-Pop Anthem:** This song is a masterclass in the 4th generation's "girl crush" concept. Instead of lyrics about pining for someone, it's about establishing boundaries. Lines like **"Don't call me honey, 'cause I ain't your sweet girl"** and **"I'm not curious at all about your next lame excuse"** are direct, unapologetic, and empowering. This wasn't just a B-side; it was a foundational pillar of IVE's "self-love" brand, which they would later explore in songs like "I AM."

**3. Global Language Play:** The chorus cheekily ends with **"Bye, sayonara."** Mixing English, a Western symbolic phrase (XOXO), and a Japanese farewell isn't random. It creates a universally understood message of finality. It's a playful, almost sarcastic way to say "goodbye forever" on a global scale. Honestly, the sass is off the charts.

<h2 style="color: #00aaff;">Behind the Scenes & Visual Insights</h2>

**1. A Statement B-Side:** In K-Pop, it's not always a given for a B-side track to get a full-blown music video. The fact that Starship Entertainment invested in a high-quality MV for "XOXO" showed immense confidence in IVE's debut. They weren't just a one-hit wonder with "ELEVEN"; they arrived with a fully-formed identity and a solid musical direction.

**2. The Power of Y2K:** The MV's styling—plaid skirts, edgy crops, bold accessories—tapped perfectly into the resurgent Y2K fashion trend of 2021. It positioned IVE as not just musically talented but also as trendsetters, resonating strongly with their target Gen Z audience.

**3. Cementing the 'IVE' Attitude:** Looking back, "XOXO" was just as important as "ELEVEN" in defining IVE. While "ELEVEN" showed their chic, mysterious, and almost magical side, "XOXO" revealed their fiery, relatable, and rebellious spirit. It proved they had range and a personality that fans could rally behind. It’s no wonder DIVEs still consider it one of their best tracks.
