<a name="tldr"></a><h2>Quick Summary: The Vibe Check</h2><div class="content-section-box">
"HEYA" presents a powerful, mythical concept where IVE embodies celestial heroines confronting a tiger who desires the sun. The vibe is fierce and visually rich, steeped in traditional Korean aesthetics, telling an allegorical story of ambition and capturing what you desire most.<div class="related-reading-box"><strong>Related reading:</strong><a href="/search/label/MV%20Explained">More K-POP MV Explained</a> ·<a href="/search/label/Streaming%20Guide">K-POP Streaming Guide</a></div></div><a name="quick-facts"></a><h2>Quick Facts & Credits</h2><div class="content-section-box"><div class="quick-facts-grid"><div><strong>Artist</strong>: IVE (아이브)</div><div><strong>Song</strong>: “해야 (HEYA)”</div><div><strong>Album</strong>: IVE SWITCH</div><div><strong>Release</strong>: 2024-04-29</div><div><strong>Agency</strong>: STARSHIP Entertainment</div><div><strong>Director</strong>: Son Seung-hee (SUSHIVISUAL)</div><div><strong>Genre</strong>: K-Pop, Dance, Trap</div><div><strong>MV ID</strong>: b_z-I62B6sE</div></div></div><a name="story-on-screen"></a><h2>The Story You See on Screen</h2><div class="content-section-box">
The music video unfolds like an ancient scroll painting brought to life. It begins with imagery reminiscent of traditional Korean folklore, introducing a fearsome white tiger fixated on the sun. The members of IVE appear as powerful, mystical beings, adorned in modernized hanbok and ornate accessories. Throughout the video, they perform sharp, commanding choreography in settings that evoke ancient temples and celestial landscapes. The narrative follows their confrontation with the tiger, not as victims, but as powerful entities who seek to tame the beast or perhaps claim the sun for themselves. The visual climax sees them asserting their dominance, ending the mythical tale on their own terms.</div><a name="lyrics-meaning"></a><h2>Lyrics & meaning</h2><div class="content-section-box"><h3>The Intent Behind the Hook & Cultural Nuance</h3>
The title "해야 (HEYA)" is a brilliant piece of wordplay. On the surface, it's an old-fashioned exclamation, but it phonetically breaks down into "해" (Hae), meaning "sun," and "야" (Ya), a casual way to call out to someone. Therefore, "HEYA" can be interpreted as "Hey, Sun!" This directly connects to the MV's folklore theme.

Furthermore, "해야" is an archaic form of "해야 해" (haeya hae), which translates to "I must do it" or "I have to get it." This dual meaning perfectly captures the song's lyrical theme: a bold, almost predatory declaration of desire. The lyrics speak of targeting something and relentlessly pursuing it, just like a tiger hunting its prey. This confident ambition is a signature of IVE's musical identity.

<strong>Korean Lyrics</strong><br>
<p>
Yeah, I-V-E<br>
Heya, heya, heya, heya, heya<br>
Heya, heya, heya, heya, heya
</p><p>
난 눈을 뜨고<br>
가장 먼저 너를 찾아<br>
내 발톱 밑에<br>
새빨간 Heart<br>
넌 사냥감<br>
내 발자국<br>
남겨놨어<br>
가장 깊숙한 곳<br>
도망가 봤자<br>
내 시야 속<br>
넌 결국엔<br>
돌아오게 될 걸
</p><p>
됐어, 그만<br>
시간 낭비<br>
내숭 떨지 마<br>
더 솔직하게<br>
굴어 봐 봐<br>
넌 애가 타<br>
더 안달 나<br>
날 원하잖아
</p><p>
이미 난<br>
네 머리 꼭대기 위<br>
맘만 먹으면<br>
널 가질 수 있지
</p><p>
갖고 싶어, 해야, 해야, 해야<br>
노렸어, 너 해야, 해야, 해야<br>

</p><p>
어설픈 네 발톱<br>
귀엽기만 한 걸<br>
어둠 속 빛나는<br>
두 눈을 반짝여<br>
날 가졌다고<br>
믿게 한 순간<br>
넌 내 손안에 있어
</p><p>
Yeah<br>

Yeah, I-V-E<br>
Heya, heya, heya, heya, heya<br>
Heya, heya, heya, heya, heya
</p><p>
I open my eyes<br>
And look for you first thing<br>
Under my claws<br>
A bright red Heart<br>
You're the prey<br>
My footprints<br>
I've left them<br>
In the deepest place<br>
Even if you run<br>
Within my sight<br>
In the end<br>
You'll come back to me
</p><p>
Alright, that's enough<br>
Wasting time<br>
Don't be coy<br>
Just be<br>
More honest<br>
You're getting impatient<br>
More restless<br>
You want me, don't you?
</p><p>
I'm already<br>
On top of your head (in control)<br>
If I just decide to<br>
I can have you
</p><p>
I want to have you, heya, heya, heya<br>
I've aimed for you, heya, heya, heya<br>
I covet you, heya, heya, heya<br>
I'll have you for sure, heya, heya, heya<br>
Heya, heya, heya

I want it<br>
Look at me<br>
Look closer<br>
Me, who's aiming for you<br>
I like it<br>
That mesmerizes you<br>
I cast a spell<br>
Abracadabra

You're already<br>
In the palm of my hand<br>
If I just decide to<br>
I can have you

I want to have you, heya, heya, heya<br>
I've aimed for you, heya, heya, heya<br>
I covet you, heya, heya, heya<br>
I'll have you for sure, heya, heya, heya

Your clumsy claws<br>
Are just cute<br>
Shining in the darkness<br>
My two eyes sparkle<br>
The moment you believed<br>
You had me<br>
You are in my hands
</p><p>
Yeah<br>
Heya, heya, heya, heya, heya<br>

</div><a name="bts-insights"></a><h2>Behind the Scenes & Visual Insights</h2><div class="content-section-box">
The "HEYA" music video is a masterclass in cultural storytelling. Director Son Seung-hee weaves a narrative deeply rooted in Korean folklore, specifically tales of tigers and the sun.
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Sun-Eating Tiger (해를 삼킨 호랑이):</strong> The central narrative draws from a Korean folktale about a tiger so ambitious it tries to devour the sun and moon. In IVE's interpretation, the members are not victims of this beast; they are the powerful protagonists who confront, tame, and ultimately control this force of nature to achieve their desires. The "sun" becomes a metaphor for their goals and ambitions.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual Motifs:</strong> The video is rich with traditional Korean aesthetics. The members wear modernized <em>hanbok</em> (traditional clothing), adorned with <em>norigae</em> (tassled ornaments) and elaborate hairpins. The settings are inspired by ancient palaces, and the story is often framed within <em>minhwa</em> (Korean folk painting) style scroll art, reinforcing the folktale theme.</li>
  <li><strong>Feminine Power:</strong> The video reinterprets a classic tale through a modern, powerful female lens. IVE's confident performance and commanding presence turn the folklore into a story of their own agency and strength.</li>
</ul>
</div><a name="fan-takeaways"></a><h2>Fan Takeaways</h2><div class="content-section-box">
