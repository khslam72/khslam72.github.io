<h2>Quick Summary: The Vibe Check</h2>
<div class="content-section-box">
'XOXO' visualizes the end of a relationship through a chic, high-fashion lens. The MV portrays the members confidently discarding symbols of a past love, redefining "XOXO" from "hugs and kisses" to a final, decisive "game over." Musically, it's an addictive dance-pop track with a sassy bassline, perfectly embodying IVE's signature confident charm.

<h2>The Story You See on Screen</h2>
<div class="content-section-box">
The MV is set in a series of luxurious, high-teen-coded environments: a lavish locker room, a stylishly decorated bedroom, and a rooftop party. The narrative follows the members as they systematically erase a past lover. We see Yujin crossing out a name in a diary, Wonyoung snipping a photo in half, and Liz tearing up a love letter. The recurring motif is the "X," which appears on chalkboards, phone screens, and even in the choreography, symbolizing a firm rejection.

<h2>Lyrics & meaning</h2>
<div class="content-section-box">
<h3>The Intent Behind the Hook & Cultural Nuance</h3>
The lyrics cleverly subvert the sweet meaning of "XOXO." The hook, "My XOXO is not for you," turns a term of endearment into a cold dismissal. Lines like "The O was a circle I drew around your name / The X is for the mistake you became" are direct and unapologetic. It’s a modern breakup anthem that champions self-respect over lingering affection, a message that resonates strongly with IVE's core "self-love" narrative.

<h2>Behind the Scenes & Visual Insights</h2>
<div class="content-section-box">
The visual concept leans heavily into a "Gossip Girl"-esque aesthetic, blending luxury with a rebellious teen spirit. The director uses quick cuts and close-ups on the members' expressions to emphasize their confident and dismissive attitude. The color palette contrasts soft pastels with sharp, bold blacks and reds, visually representing the shift from sweet love to a cold ending.

<h2>Fan Takeaways</h2>
<div class="content-section-box">
For fans (DIVEs), 'XOXO' is another empowering anthem that reinforces IVE's image as confident, self-assured young women. It's a stylish and satisfying story of taking back control, making it the perfect song to listen to after a breakup or when you need a boost of self-esteem.
